# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Analysis Overview
The were two primary purposes of this analysis. First, I found the number of employees that were retiring based on their title. Next, I determined the eligibility of current employees to engage in a mentorship program. 

## Results
There were a few insights that I gained by looking at the various tables that I created. 

-Many of the employees who have already left the company had been working there for 10 years or less
- There will be many senior engineers and senior staff (25,916 and 24,926, respectively) that are about to retire, though there will be very few managers (2) that are about to retire
- There are multiple senior members of the company that qualify for mentorship eligibility
- There are no eligible mentors for the manager positions


## Summary

### Effects of the "silver tsunami"
There are many positions that will need to be filled as a result of the "silver tsunami". There are 133,776 employees that are about to retire and many of the positions they hold are senior positions. Not only will it be difficult to fill that large number of positions, but it'll be difficult to hire individuals for the senior positions. Fortunately, many of the eligible mentors were in senior positions and can help prepare prospective employees for the high positions, though filling the numbers will be difficult. 

### Mentors to Open Positions Ratio
I do not believe there are enough retirement-ready employees to mentor future employees of Pewlett-Hackard. Currently, there are 133,776 employees that are retiring, whereas there are only 1,549 employees eligible to mentor. Depending on the position that the mentor holds, they may have to mentor an impossible amount of prospective employees if they want to fill all of the roles that are impacted by the "silver tsunami". For example, each senior engineer would have to mentor approximately 88 individuals to fulfill the opening of the roles. I got this number by dividing number of senior engineers that are retiring (25,916) by the number of senior engineers eligible for mentoring (294). Below I have included images of both tables.
